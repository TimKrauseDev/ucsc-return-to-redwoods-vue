    </p>
    <p>We can't wait to see you back on campus!</p>
    <p>
      First things first, you gotta check in and grab your keys! Stop by the
      Founders Glen (that lawn right near the entrance of the Cowell Circle) and
      get everything you need to start off the weekend. You'll check in at the
      main table, grab your name tag and a program, and then go over to the
      Conference Services table to get parking permits and everything you need
      for on-campus housing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't worry, we'll have some 20 minute parking so that you can check in
      and unload all of your stuff before parking your car. Showing up after 6?
      No problem! Staff will be available to check people in as late as 8 p.m.
